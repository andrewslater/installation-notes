# It is often useful to install a webserver such as nginx (https://www.nginx.com/) in front of web applications running on a server.
# Doing so provides some important benefits:
# - You can have multiple applications listening on single port
# - Your web applications can be run by non-privileged users and listen on non-priviliged ports but still be accessible on ports such as 80 and 443 
# - Restarting nginx is much faster than restarting the web application in the case where you need to update an SSL cert

# Example nginx vhost config for acting as a proxy
# Listens on ports 80 (http) and 443 (https) for example.com and www.example.com and forwards to localhost:8080 (http) and localhost:8443(https)
