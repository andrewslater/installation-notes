# Ubuntu 18.04
# Netplan configuration files are found in /etc/netplan/
# See manpage for detailed info on configuration
# 50-cloud-init.yaml existed out of the box for me (and was the only file in /etc/netplan/) but I think this can vary
# Configuration should look like (e.g. to set static ip to 192.168.122.220):

network:
    ethernets:
        ens3:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses: [192.168.122.220/24]
            gateway4: 192.168.122.1
            nameservers:
              addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.4.4]
    version: 2

# Run the following to apply changes:
sudo netplan apply
