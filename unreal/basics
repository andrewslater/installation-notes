### Using Low Poly Palette Textures
When using one of the low poly palettes you will need to make the following adjustments in UE4 after importing from Blender:

Texture Resource -> Compression -> Compression Settings -> Set to "BC7 (DX11, optional A)"
                 -> Texture -> Filter -> Set to "Nearest"
